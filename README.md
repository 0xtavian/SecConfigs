# SecConfigs
Config files for popular recon tools generated with Github Actions 

Have you ever needed a config file just to find out that the developers didn't commit the default config file in the repo? <br>
Instead of using that random file on gist or having to install the tool locally just to acquire the config file, you can rest assured these config files are unchanged from the originals. <br>

How it works: <br>

Install tool in a Github Action <br>
Execute tool once to generate the config file <br>
Copy the config file back to the repo <br>
Repeat for every new update! <br>
